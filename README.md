# Crowd-Integrated Intelligent Traffic Management System (CITMS) 🚦

## Overview
This project proposes a Crowd-Integrated Intelligent Traffic Management System (CITMS) designed to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety by combining human-generated reports with adaptive decision logic.

Unlike traditional traffic systems that depend only on fixed sensors and preset signal timings, CITMS introduces a crowd-driven intelligence layer where road users can report real-time traffic events such as accidents, signal failures, congestion, and emergency vehicle movement using a one-tap interface.

## Key Idea
User reports act as dynamic traffic indicators, enabling faster detection of on-road incidents and more responsive signal control. The system focuses not only on traffic density but also on the nature of traffic disruptions.

## Objective
To develop a cost-effective, scalable, and adaptive traffic management approach that incorporates real-time human awareness into intelligent traffic control.

## Implementation
A modular backend simulation is implemented in C to model:

- Traffic state representation
- Agent-based signal decisions
- Reward-based optimization logic
- Adaptive system behavior

This simulation demonstrates the core decision-making mechanism of the proposed framework.
